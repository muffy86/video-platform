# UX Design Specification: AI Home Remodeling Assistant

## User Experience Strategy

### Design Philosophy: Human-Centered AI Collaboration

The core principle is creating an AI mentor that guides users through complex remodeling decisions using voice-first interaction, advanced computer vision, and contextual intelligence. The system should feel like having a knowledgeable friend who understands both your vision and the technical realities of construction.

## User Personas & Scenarios

### Primary Persona: Alex - DIY Homeowner
- **Background**: 35-year-old professional, owns first home
- **Goals**: Renovate kitchen and living room, maximize space and value
- **Pain Points**: No construction experience, overwhelmed by options, budget concerns
- **Device Usage**: Android Pixel 9 Pro Fold, prefers voice interaction while working

### Primary Use Case: Kitchen Renovation Planning
**Scenario**: Alex wants to remove a wall between kitchen and living room to create an open floor plan, but needs to understand feasibility, cost, and design options.

## Detailed User Journey Map

### Phase 1: Project Initiation (Voice-First Onboarding)

#### Initial Interaction
```
AI: "Hi Alex! I'm your AI remodeling assistant. I can help you visualize 
changes to your space using your camera and provide expert guidance. 
What project are you thinking about today?"

User: "I want to open up my kitchen to the living room"

AI: "Great choice! Open floor plans are very popular and can really 
transform how a space feels. Let's start by taking some photos so I 
can analyze your current layout. I'll guide you through capturing 
the right angles."
```

#### Guided Photo Capture
1. **AI provides real-time voice guidance**
   - "Hold your phone horizontally and slowly pan from left to right"
   - "Perfect! Now let's get a shot of that wall you're thinking about removing"
   - "I can see the kitchen island - can you walk around it so I can understand the full layout?"

2. **Computer vision provides immediate feedback**
   - Live overlay showing detected walls, windows, doors
   - Real-time measurements appearing on screen
   - Quality indicators for photo clarity and coverage

3. **Progressive capture workflow**
   - Multiple angles of the target wall
   - Overall room context shots
   - Close-ups of electrical outlets, switches, vents
   - Load-bearing indicators (beams, supports)

### Phase 2: AI Analysis & Initial Assessment

#### Automated Space Analysis
```
AI: "I'm analyzing your space now... I can see this appears to be a 
load-bearing wall based on the ceiling structure. Let me bring in 
my structural expert to provide more detailed analysis."

Structural Agent: "Looking at the beam pattern and wall thickness, 
this wall is likely load-bearing. However, there are definitely 
options for opening it up safely. Would you like to see some 
possibilities?"
```

#### Multi-Agent Consultation Display
- **Visual agent indicators** showing which AI is speaking
- **Expertise badges** (structural, design, project management)
- **Confidence levels** for each assessment
- **Real-time collaboration** between agents visible to user

### Phase 3: Collaborative Design Exploration

#### Voice-Driven Option Generation
```
Design Expert: "I see three main approaches for this space:

Option 1: Partial wall removal with a support beam - maintains 
structural integrity while creating visual connection.

Option 2: Installing a steel beam to fully remove the wall - 
more expensive but creates completely open space.

Option 3: Creating a large archway opening - less invasive, 
maintains some separation.

Would you like me to show you what each would look like?"
```

#### Interactive AR Visualization
1. **Real-time rendering** of each option over live camera feed
2. **Gesture controls** for exploring different angles
3. **Voice commands** for switching between options
4. **Measurement overlays** showing dimensions and clearances

#### Collaborative Refinement
```
User: "I like option 2 but I'm worried about the cost"

Project Manager: "Steel beam installation typically runs $2,000-4,000 
for this size opening. Let me show you what's involved and how we 
might phase the work to spread costs."

[Cost breakdown visualization appears]

AI: "We could also explore a engineered beam solution that might 
be more cost-effective. Would you like to see that option?"
```

### Phase 4: Detailed Planning & Documentation

#### Comprehensive Project Planning
1. **Timeline visualization** with interactive milestones
2. **Permit requirements** with local code compliance
3. **Contractor recommendations** based on project scope
4. **Material specifications** with sourcing options

#### Voice-Guided Decision Making
```
AI: "Now let's talk about finishes. Since you're opening the space, 
we'll want flooring that flows between both areas. I can see you 
currently have hardwood in the living room and tile in the kitchen. 
What's your preference for the unified space?"

User: "I'd like to extend the hardwood throughout"

Design Expert: "Excellent choice! That'll create beautiful flow. 
I can show you how to match the existing wood or we could explore 
a complementary tone that bridges both spaces..."
```

## User Interface Design Patterns

### Voice Interface Design
